            <h1>Cricket — More Than a Game</h1>
            <p class = "description">Cricket isn’t just a sport you watch for entertainment. It’s a game of patience, pressure, skill, and decision-making. 
                If you think cricket is “just hitting a ball,” you haven’t understood it yet. 
                Every match is a mental battle as much as a physical one.
                Played and loved by millions across the world, cricket connects people
                across countries, cultures, and generations.

            <h2>Origin and Evolution of Cricket</h2>
            <p class = "info">
                Cricket started in England in the 16th century as a simple village game. 
                Over time, it evolved into an international sport played at the highest professional level. 
                Today, cricket is dominated by countries like India, Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, and many others.

                Cricket didn’t stay traditional — it adapted. That’s why it survived.
